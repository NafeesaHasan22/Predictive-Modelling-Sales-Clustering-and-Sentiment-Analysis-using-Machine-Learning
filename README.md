Task 1

Title:
Income Level Prediction Using Demographic and Economic Factors Through Classification Techniques

1.Introduction

Predicts income categories based on demographic and socioeconomic factors using classification techniques.

2. Dataset Overview:

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Size: 32,561 entries
Features: Include demographic and economic variables such as age, education, occupation, and hours worked.
Target Variable: Binary classification (<=50K or >50K income categories).

3.Project Objectives:

Understand the relationship between demographic variables and income.
Build classification models to predict income levels.

4. Methodology

1.Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values.
Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical data.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis:

Visualized relationships using pair plots, correlation heatmaps.
Investigated patterns and trends in each dataset.

3.Model Development:
Build classification models(e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors and Na√Øve Bayes).
For sentiment analysis, applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as TF-IDF and CountVectorizer.

4.Model Evaluation:
Used metrices like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate performance.

5. Results and Insights:

Decision Tree achieved the highest accuracy of 85%.
Age, education level, and hours worked were the most significant predictors.

6. Technologies Used:

Programming language: Python
Tools and Libraries:
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Plotly for visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning models
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for sentiment analysis
TF-IDF and CountVectorizer for text preprocessing

7. How to run the Project:

Prerequisites:
Python 3.X
Jupyter Notebook installed
Required libraries (install via pip install -r requirements.txt)
Open jupyter Notebook
Open the corresponding .ipynb file:

Classification Algorithms.ipynb

Task 2

Title:
Analyzing Retail and Warehouse sales Trends: Insights from Supplier and Product Performance

1.Introduction:
Identifies trends in sales performance across suppliers, products, and channels.

2.Dataset Overview:
Source: Kaggle (Retail and warehouse dataset) 
Size: Multiple sales transactions with categorical and numerical data.
Features: Year, month, supplier, products details, retail sales, warehouse sales, and transfers.

3. Project Objective:
Identify key sales trends across retail and warehouse channels.
Analyze supplier and product performance.

4. Results and Insights:
Supplier had consistent performance across channels, contributing 40% of total sales.
Product Type exhibited the highest retail transfers during seasonal periods.

Task 3

Title:
Sentiment Analysis of Game App Reviews for Enhanced User Experience and Product Development

1.Introduction:
Performs sentiment analysis on user reviews to enhance app performance and user satisfaction.

2.Dataset Overview:
Source: Kaggle 
Size: Thousands of entries
Features: Textual reviews and sentiment labels (1 for positive, 0 for negative)

3.Project Objective:
Classify user reviews into positive or negative sentiments.
Provide actionable insights for app improvement.

4.Results and Insights:
Sentiment analysis achieved an accuracy of 90% using Logistic Regression with TF-IDF.
The primary concerns in negative reviews were app crashes and slow performance.
